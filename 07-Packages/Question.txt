Create 2 packages named algebra and trigonometry.
Create class named Complex_numbers in algebra package. 
Create class named Trigo_calc in Trigonometry package.
The Complex_numbers class should have two complex numbers and display them.
The Trigo_calc should take the values sin 60 and cos 60 and dislay the corresponding values.
Import these two packages in a java file containing the main method.
Then perform addition and subtraction of 2 complex numbers.
Also prove that (sin 60)^2 + (cos ^60)^2 = 1.
