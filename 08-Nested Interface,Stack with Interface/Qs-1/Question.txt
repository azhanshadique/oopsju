Write a program in java to create 2 classes that implements an interface.
Classes should provide different implementations of a method which was declared by interface.
Create two instances of two different classes and a reference variable of interface to call method with different implementations.
Also show that reference variable does not have access to those methods that are defined by class and not there in interface declaration.
